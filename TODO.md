# Add Professional Profile Photos to Browse Cards and Implement Portfolio Upload

## Overview
This TODO tracks the completion of profile photo integration and portfolio image upload functionality. Profile photos are now integrated into Browse cards and ProfessionalSetup. The next phase adds portfolio uploads in Profile.js, dynamic display in FeaturedProfessionals.js, and resolves any remaining merge conflicts.

## Completed: Profile Photo Integration
- [x] Update backend ProfessionalProfile model to include profile_image field
- [x] Modify professional-profile API endpoint to handle profile_image upload
- [x] Update get_professionals API to return profile_image for each professional
- [x] Add profile photo upload field to ProfessionalSetup.js form
- [x] Update Browse.js to fetch professionals from API instead of using hardcoded data
- [x] Test the photo upload and display functionality

## Steps

### Step 1: Edit src/pages/Profile.js
- Add file input fields for each portfolio item when in editing mode.
- Modify `addPortfolioItem` to prompt for file selection before adding a new item.
- Update `handleSave` to collect all portfolio data (titles, descriptions, files) into FormData and send a PUT request to `/api/professional-profile` (include user_id from auth).
- Refresh portfolio state from the API response after save.
- Update image rendering to use `item.image_url` from backend (fallback to placeholder).
- Add Authorization header with JWT token from AuthContext to API calls.
- Ensure form handles multiple files and limits to 4 items.

### Step 2: Edit src/components/FeaturedProfessionals.js
- Remove hardcoded `allProfessionals` array.
- Add `useState` for professionals and `useEffect` to fetch from `/api/professionals?category=${categoryFilter}` on mount and filter change.
- Update filtering logic to apply to fetched data (map role to category).
- Adjust professional rendering: Use API fields (name, role=category/specialty, portfolio as array of {image_url}).
- Update carousel and modal to render dynamic portfolio: `<img src={item.image_url} alt={item.title} />`.
- Handle empty states and loading (add spinner).
- Keep existing styling and interactions (modal, slide timer).

### Step 3: Test the Implementation Locally
- Start backend: `cd server && python run.py` (ensure DB is created, uploads folder exists).
- Start frontend: `npm start`.
- Login as professional user.
- Go to /profile, edit mode, add portfolio item: Select file, enter title/desc, save â€“ verify upload to /static/uploads/ and DB.
- Check FeaturedProfessionals component: Images should display uploaded ones (refresh page).
- Test edge cases: No files, invalid file types, >4 items (limit in backend), auth errors.
- Verify no console errors, images load correctly (CORS if needed).

Status: [ ] Not started

### Step 4: Resolve Any Remaining PR Conflicts
- Fetch upstream: `git fetch upstream`.
- Merge main into local branch: `git merge upstream/main`.
- Manually resolve any remaining conflicts (combine upload logic with upstream changes, remove markers).
- Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts: integrate portfolio upload"`.
- Push: `git push origin nathan-functionalities` (updates PR automatically).

Status: [ ] Not started

### Step 5: Final Verification and PR Update
- Check GitHub PR: Conflicts should be gone; review changes.
- If needed, rebase: `git rebase upstream/main` then force-push with `--force-with-lease`.
- Test PR branch on GitHub (if CI/CD) or locally.
- Mark PR ready for review.

## Notes
- Backend (/api/professional-profile) already handles uploads; no changes needed.
- Use FormData for multipart uploads; include 'user_id' or rely on JWT.
- Fallback images: Use Unsplash placeholders if no upload.
- After Step 2 completion, update this TODO by editing the status checkboxes.
